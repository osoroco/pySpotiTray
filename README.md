pySpotiTray
=============

After an upgrade, the spotify linux client (version 1.0.28.89) no longer had a tray icon that allowed simple access to what's playing/play/pause/previous/next controls. 

Mediocre programming knowledge and a desire to remedy this issue have spawned this tray app.

Feel free to fix and/or leave feedback on how it can be improved.
